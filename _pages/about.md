<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, my name is Chen-Chieh Liao (廖振傑). I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en).
<!-- under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Hideki Koike](https://www.vogue.cs.titech.ac.jp/koike).  -->
<!-- I am also serving as an associate researcher at [Cygames](https://www.cygames.co.jp/en/).  -->
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Institute of Science Tokyo in 2025. Prior to this, I received both my B.E. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2020 and 2022, respectively.
My research focuses on human-computer interaction, mixed/augmented reality, visual computing, and machine learning, with a particular interest in developing novel approaches to integrate these fields in innovative and impactful systems.
